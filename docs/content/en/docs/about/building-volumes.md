BuildingVolumes is a global initiative by creatives, software engineers, teachers, and artists with the aim to create a free and open-source volumetric capture and playback pipeline. The initative is led by [Ciny Poremba](https://www2.ocadu.ca/bio/cindy-poremba) and [Andrew Hogue](https://ontariotechu.ca/experts/fbit/andrew-hogue.php).

We want to create free and sustainable tools for small artists, creatives, filmographers, game artists and everyone interested in the creation of Volumetric Video.

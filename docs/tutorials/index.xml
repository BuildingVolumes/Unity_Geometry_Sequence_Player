Intro #
To gurantee high realtime performance, the Geometry Sequence Streamer can only read sequences that are in special file format (.ply for models, .dds for textures). However, to support a broad spectrum of input formats and make the usage of this plugin as easy as possible, we provide a small converter tool which takes in almost all widely used mesh and image formats, and converts them into the correct format for the plugin.</description></item><item><title>Unity package installation</title><link>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/installation/</guid><description>üëâüèª Make sure that your Unity project is using Unity 2020.1 or above, versions below are not supported!
Package Installation #
Open your Unity project, and in the toolbar, go to Windows &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Package Manager
In the Package Manager window, go into the upper left corner and click on the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; Button &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Add package from Git URL Copy and paste the following URL and click Add: https://github.com/Elite-Volumetric-Capture-Sqad/Geometry_Sequence_Streaming_Package.git Unity now installs the package, and after a short time it should show up in your manager.</description></item><item><title>Basic playback</title><link>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/editor-playback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/editor-playback/</guid><description>Intro #

After you&amp;rsquo;ve prepared and converted your sequence, you can now stream them from your disk right into Unity! This section shows you how to use the streaming and playback components inside of the editor, to setup a simple playback scene.
Playback #
Open your Unity scene in which you want to implement the playback.</description></item><item><title>Timeline integration</title><link>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/timeline-integration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/timeline-integration/</guid><description>Intro #
üí° All of the features explained here in this tutorial can also be found in the Sample Scene 02_Timeline_Example
For playback scenarios, where a precise control of the playback, or cohesive animation with other objects is needed, the package also supports the playback from the Unity Timeline.
Setting up a timeline clip #
Open the timeline window by going to Window &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Sequencing &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Timeline in the main toolbar Create a new empty gameobject, or select the one you want to attach the timeline to.</description></item><item><title>Scripting API</title><link>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/scripting-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://elite-volumetric-capture-sqad.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Streaming/docs/tutorials/scripting-api/</guid><description>üí° All of the features explained here in this tutorial can also be found in the Sample Scene 03_API_Example
Intro #
Beside playback from timeline and in the editor, this package also allows you to control playback from your own scripts. This is useful, if you have for example playback control by the user via UI buttons, or you want interactivly integrate playback inside your application.
Setup #
To use the Scripting API, you need to have a gameobject in the scene that has the Geometry Sequence Player and Geometry Sequence Stream components attached to it.</description></item></channel></rss>

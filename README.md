### A package for Unity to efficiently playback large pointcloud and (textured) mesh sequences

## Overview:

This package allows you to playback large and heavy geometric frame sequences (where each frame of an animated sequence is saved in a single file, like a 3D flipbook) inside of Unity.
The package was orginally developed to allow playback of Volumetric Video captures, but can also be used to play any animated 3D-sequences, that are unsuitable for bone or blendshape workflows.
Usecases are for example: Simulations (physics, fluids), animated meshes with changing topology and animated pointclouds.

## Features
- Streams sequences directly from disk, no import into Unity needed
- Support for animated Pointclouds, Meshes and Textures
- Control your playback with a custom Editor UI
- Timeline support
- Scripting API
